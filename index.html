                <p>JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language used to make webpages interactive (e.g., having complex animations, clickable buttons, popup menus, etc.).</p>
                <p>JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array, Date, and Math, and a core set of language elements such as operators, control structures, and statements. Core JavaScript can be extended for a variety of purposes by supplementing it with additional objects; for example:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Client-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects to control a browser and its Document Object Model (DOM). For example, client-side extensions allow an application to place elements on an HTML form and respond to user events such as mouse clicks, form input, and page navigation.</li>
                    <li>Server-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects relevant to running JavaScript on a server. For example, server-side extensions allow an application to communicate with a database, provide continuity of information from one invocation to another of the application, or perform file manipulations on a server.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>This guide assumes you have the following basic background:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>A general understanding of the Internet and the World Wide Web (WWW).</li>
                    <li>Good working knowledge of HyperText Markup Language (HTML).</li>
                    <li>Some programming experience. If you are new to programming, try one of the tutorials linked on the main page about JavaScript.</li>

            <header>Javascript & Java</header>
            <article>
                <p>JavaScript and Java are similar in some ways but fundamentally different in some others. The JavaScript language resembles Java but does not have Java's static typing and strong type checking. JavaScript follows most Java expression syntax, naming conventions and basic control-flow constructs which was the reason why it was renamed from LiveScript to JavaScript.</p>
                <p>In contrast to Java's compile-time system of classes built by declarations, JavaScript supports a runtime system based on a small number of data types representing numeric, Boolean, and string values. JavaScript has a prototype-based object model instead of the more common class-based object model. The prototype-based model provides dynamic inheritance; that is, what is inherited can vary for individual objects. JavaScript also supports functions without any special declarative requirements. Functions can be properties of objects, executing as loosely typed methods.</p>
                <p>JavaScript is a very free-form language compared to Java. You do not have to declare all variables, classes, and methods. You do not have to be concerned with whether methods are public, private, or protected, and you do not have to implement interfaces. Variables, parameters, and function return types are not explicitly typed.</p>

        <section class="main-section" id="Hello_World">
            <header>Hello World</header>
            <article>
                <p>To get started with writing JavaScript, open the Web Console in multi-line mode, and write your first "Hello world" JavaScript code:</p>
                <code>(function(){
                    "use strict";
                    /* Start of your code */
                    function greetMe(yourName) {
                      alert('Hello ' + yourName);
                    }
                  
                    greetMe('World');
                    /* End of your code */
                  })();</code>
                <p>Press Cmd+Enter or Ctrl+Enter (or click the Run button) to watch it unfold in your browser!</p>
            </article>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="Comments">
            <header>Comments</header>
            <article>
                <p>The syntax of comments is the same as in C++ and in many other languages:</p>
                <code>// a one line comment
    
                    /* this is a longer,
                     * multi-line comment
                     */
                    
                    /* You can't, however, /* nest comments */ SyntaxError */
                    </code>
                    <p>Comments behave like whitespace, and are discarded during script execution.</p>

                <p>JavaScript has three kinds of variable declarations.</p>
                <p>var</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Declares a variable, optionally initializing it to a value.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>let</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Declares a block-scoped, local variable, optionally initializing it to a value.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>const</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Declares a block-scoped, read-only named constant.</li>
                </ul>
            </article>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="Evaluating_Variables">
            <header>Evaluating Variables</header>
            <article>
                <p>A variable declared using the var or let statement with no assigned value specified has the value of <span>undefined</span>.</p>
                <p>An attempt to access an undeclared variable results in a <span>ReferenceError</span> exception being thrown:</p>
                <code>var a;
                    console.log('The value of a is ' + a); // The value of a is undefined
                    
                    console.log('The value of b is ' + b); // The value of b is undefined
                    var b;
                    // This one may puzzle you until you read 'Variable hoisting' below
                    
                    console.log('The value of c is ' + c); // Uncaught ReferenceError: c is not defined
                    
                    let x;
                    console.log('The value of x is ' + x); // The value of x is undefined
                    
                    console.log('The value of y is ' + y); // Uncaught ReferenceError: y is not defined
                    let y; </code>
                    <p>You can use <span>undefined</span> to determine whether a variable has a value. In the following code, the variable <span>input</span> is not assigned a value, and the <span>if</span> statement evaluates to <span>true</span>.</p>
                    <code>var input;
                        if (input === undefined) {
                          doThis();
                        } else {
                          doThat();
                        }</code>
                    <p>The undefined value behaves as false when used in a boolean context. For example, the following code executes the function myFunction because the myArray element is undefined:</p>
                    <code>var myArray = [];
                        if (!myArray[0]) myFunction();</code>
                    <p>The undefined value converts to NaN when used in numeric context.</p>
                    <code>var a;
                        a + 2;  // Evaluates to NaN</code>
                    <p>When you evaluate a null variable, the null value behaves as 0 in numeric contexts and as false in boolean contexts. For example:</p>
                    <code>var n = null;
                        console.log(n * 32); // Will log 0 to the console</code>
